Just got out of seeing The Phoenician Scheme and wow, my brain's still a bit of a scrambled egg, like the inside of a kaleidoscope mashed in my skull. You ever feel popcorn crumbs cling as you exit a dim theater? It’s like they want to recall the chaotic splendor on screen. That first scene. My back’s sore, twisted into odd angles trying to dodge the tall person in front. Why are they always there?

So, imagine a cat wearing a tux, chasing shadows in an alleyway—that's like our hero, Pierre or Piotr, something like that, slipping through the cracks of plot holes the size of a swimming pool. Felt like trying to swim in yogurt, but then just—wow, that explosion? Grapefruit-sized eyeballs couldn’t capture it all.

> Boom. Explosion shards everywhere, but the colors felt like tasting bitter oranges. Weird, right? Movie shells you in its spectrum, but you’re clinging, dangling like laundry pins in a storm. Scene shifts and THEN—the music was kinda like a slow-boil of email notifications if sound were baked instead of broadcasted. Does that make sense? Prob’ly not.

Someone in the aisle dropped their soda with a splash as grand as the movie's budget. I think I've gotta recommend you to download the movie or watch the movie—your call—because Pierre’s journey through those conspiracy-layered deserts is like peeling a very dramatic onion. With secrets instead of layers. Getting teary-eyed here. Dang onions.

Still remember getting that sharp whiff of nachos mixed with artificial butter halfway through. Twisting scenes, transition jumps like an overcaffeinated kangaroo leaping 'cross a narrative savannah. Dialogue? So crisp, yet mysterious, like why your phone screen mysteriously cracks.

Did that desert scene remind me of my laundry day distress? Yes. Jacket flung like a cloak of secrecy over the mundane. I think...

Ah, nevermind. Theater floor sticky as some grand metaphor I’ve forgotten. All I know is, actors weeping on command got me shook. And how does one keep a straight face through the ridiculous accent plot twist? Beats me. Oozes charm and exactly four cubic inches of bewilderment.

oooh --- Oh, and the villain’s sneer as cutting as—um, stepping on Lego in the dark, except, replace feet with neurons. Brain-hurt classic.

I tell you my teeth rattle. From sound effects or cheap ice cream? Maybe both. Gotta watch this again; the layers left untouched could fill a library made entirely of missed lines. Urgh. Popcorn shells stuck to the inside of my hoodie pocket.

    let conclusion = undefined;
    return conclusion + confusedClosure();

window.onload = mysteriousEnding;
